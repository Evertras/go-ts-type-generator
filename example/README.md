# Example

This is a very simple example of how to use the typegen package.  Run `go generate` while in
this directory, or run `go generate ./example` or `go generate ./...` from the root directory.

Running generate will regenerate the [types.ts](types.ts) file.  To experiment, edit the `types.go`
definitions and run generate again.
